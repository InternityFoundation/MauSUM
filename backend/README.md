## Problem Statement
FULLStack OpenTheme 10

Amalgamation of Weather Forecast from multiple free public data streams & APIs (Yahoo weather, Accu-weather, ForecastIo, Weather Underground, Aeris-weather, Open-weather Map etc.& many more. A more detailed list can be furnished later) & amalgamate these through some statistical averaging to produce a single integrated weather forecast stream for a particular geo location within a certain Km radius. We would like to provide this information on our App & also publish an API ifâ€‹ possible.




## What I have acheived in last 20 Hrs

MauSUM - a weather application which aggregrates data from multiple sources and gives most accurate weather data.

## Challenges
- 



## Technologies Used

- Python Flask 
    - Hit various API through HTTP, requests module
    - Independent API
- Angular 7
    - Async fetches data using obervable subscriber pattern
    - process & modification of data in UI

- HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
    - simple yet powerful

- APIs Used
    - OpenWeatherMap
    - DarkSky
    - SimpleMaps : to get indian city coordinates



## Future Modification

- Caching of data
- Google Maps Autocomplete place API
- Data from more sources
- Error handling, logging, docs

## What I am taking with me from this hackathon 
- Exploration of vast API sources available for each kind of stuff (DRY)
